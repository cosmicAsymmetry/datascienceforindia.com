      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Based at UC Berkeley, we're a group of college students who are passionate about leveraging our technical skills as tools to make a concrete impact on the world around us. We're amazed by how data science is not only applicable to our fields of study, but also how it's an entirely new discipline itself. Many of us have become a part of the growing data science community at Cal, through enrolling in and teaching classes, participating in research, and developing course material.
      </p>
      <p>

        We realized that students our age, even in some of India’s best universities, did not have an established track when it came to learning the subject. Moreover, we are appalled by the rampant structural inequalities in India when it comes to caste, religion, gender, and income, and have seen how communities at lower socioeconomic strata have been left behind in this era of technological advancement. We are thus taking a step in the right direction to ensure that Indians from every background will be exposed to a plethora of opportunities available through technology, appreciate interdisciplinary education, as well as contribute to India's rapid economic growth.

      <h2> About Us </h2>
        <h3> Our Mission </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Structured opportunities to pursue data science, which is critical for numerous professions today, at the undergraduate level and below are few and far between in India.</li>
            <li>Considering this problem, we hope to develop an awareness about data and its growing relevance, as well as an interest in pursuing and applying data science in the academic and professional worlds among Indian high school and undergraduate students</li>
            <li>We also realized that many students our age, even in some of India’s best universities, did not have an established course of study or more importantly, a community to share their passion with, when it came to learning the subject. Moreover, we are appalled by the rampant structural inequalities in India regardless of their form: gender, religion, caste, and income, and have seen how communities at lower socioeconomic strata have been left behind in this era of technological advancement. We are thus taking a step in the right direction to ensure that Indians from every background will be exposed to a plethora of opportunities available through technology, appreciate interdisciplinary education, as well as contribute to India's rapid economic growth.</li>
          </ol>
        <h3> Our Story </h3>
          <p>Founded in May 2017 by a small team of UC Berkeley undergrads, we began to design a curriculum that would teach high school students fundamental concepts of data science, taking them from introductory Python programming and statistical knowledge to basic machine learning algorithms. As we spread the word about our effort, our core team expanded to include about 20 students from institutions around the world. Our first cohort of college and high school instructors taught programs at schools in four Indian cities: Delhi, Gurgaon, Bangalore, and Chennai. Even if schools did not have computers, they still taught the theoretical content, as data literacy is our goal.</p>
        <h3> Our Impact </h3>
          <p>Since our founding, DSI has always sought to build community. In the past two months, we’ve built a thriving community of developers, teachers, and students that spans international borders.</p>

        <h3> What's Next </h3>
          <h4>We’d like to improve on our results from this summer in the following ways:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Get in touch with partners in academia and industry to refine our curriculum and give talks to DSI students about the field.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>We invited Nitika Malhotra, a data scientist at Zomato, to give a talk at Kadarpur Government School to our students about how DSI’s curriculum can help improve their job prospects as women.</li>
                </ul>

              </div>

              <li>We created webinars for volunteers to better understand the content, so would like to combine these resources with the availability of our curriculum to create online courses, with additional projects and different sets of material</li>
